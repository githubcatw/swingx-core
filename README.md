swingx-core
===========

This is just swingx-core, but I have un-deprecated JXImagePanel. This fork exists just because I needed to draw an image in a Java Swing application (that was originally a .NET application but I had to re-write it in Java because the .NET version doesn't support OS X 10.10), and the top Google result suggested to use JXImagePanel with SwingX, but JXImagePanel was deprecated (and the javadoc suggested to use a JXPanel with an ImagePainter, but the ImagePainter doesn't exist in the core), and since I modified swingx-core which is licensed under LGPL I need to make this pointless fork open source.
